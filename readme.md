Why puppeteer? Because I've already used Cheerio.js and also I've also heard that puppeteer is better in scraping.

### **How to run?**

1. Install dependencies

2. Navigate to `/src/config` to check out opitional config you want to change

3. Run app in dev mode

    `npm run dev`

4. Now wait the app to complete scraping and then navigate to export folder and take your ready file!
